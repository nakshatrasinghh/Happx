# Why should you care? 🤔

Because even if you are in a happy state of mind, you should care because your loved ones can have to deal with unhappiness and stress. You should care because you live in a society and human beings are a social animal thriving due to each other's support. 

And then you want to live in a happier world, don't you?

# How does our solution fit into all this? 🏆

We researched and found out that our lifestyle plays a colossal role in happiness. Enjoying life, Physical exercises, Yoga, Food, Music, and even the content you consume plays a hefty role in how you feel in your life; in the long run, it decides your mental state, success, and happiness in a relationship. As long as these elements maintain that sweet spot in your lifestyle, you might never even face any mental health issues and if you are facing some already, they will help you to come out of it quickly.

Ha, we know that you have already heard that somewhere, so let's get to the point! 🙆‍♀️

We built you an informative application right in your mobile. It will just show you the coolest things on Earth, someone that will teach you good habits like exercising, eating a healthy diet and laughing. But whatever it does, it will be selflessly present to improve the quality of your life. 🌻
